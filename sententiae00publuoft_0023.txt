INTRODUCTION. xix

mimae, some of whom became notorious or perhaps famous
(the word archimima occurs in inscriptions), in so far as they
were dressed at all, were dressed gaily, their chief speciality
being the ricinium, a sort of small shawl or mantilla.
Originally masks were not worn, though it seems that after-
wards a small mask covering only a small part of the cheeks
was sometimes used. In Rich's Dictionary of Roman and
Greek Antiquities (p. 425) there is a drawing of the mimic
mask, from an engraved ring. Dancing and singing were at
some period part of the performance.

The names even of the plays of Publilius are unknown to
us, except that we have in Nonius ‘Publilii Putatoribus' and
in Priscian ‘Publius in Murmidone.' The titles of mimes
generally are such as one would expect from their character 3
Aquae caldae, Augur, Compitalia, Fullo and Virgo are names
common to mimes and togatae, while Gemini, Hetaera,
Nuptiae and Piscator (as well as Fullo and Virgo) are shared
by mimes and Atellanae. ‘With the palliata,’ Teuffel says,
‘the mimus shares the titles Colax, Hetaera and Phasma, and
besides we find the following originally Greek titles of mimi:
Alexandrea, Belonistria, CophinuS, EphebuS, Necyomantia and
Scylax.'

The language of the mimes was plebeian, not to say
vulgar3 and the fun was brought only into stronger relies by
the wise saws with which some of them, those of Publilius at
any rate, were interlarded.

The chief metres used were iambic senarii and trochaic
tetrameterS, though the choliambic metre occurS‚ and probably
'a good deal of the play was sermo pedestris.

xviii INTRODUCTION.

curn lascivia imitatio ; a Graecis ita definitus ε, μῖμός ἐστι
μίμησις βίου τοί τε συγκεχωρημένα καὶ α’,σ-υγχῶρητα περιέχωνῖ
Evanthius says the mimes were so named ‘ab diuturna
imitatione vilium rerum et levium personarum,' while Isidore
says ‘mimi sunt dicti graeca appellatione quod rerum
humanarum sint imitationes.’ Plutarch says that neither the
ὑποθέσεις nor the παίγνια (two kinds of mime) were fit for
representation at dinner, the former being too long for such a
stage and the latter too broad. Teuffel gives a series of
quotations which prove the identity of the planipes and the
mimus, though possibly the former may have been the earlier
name—derived from the actor having bare feet, not aspiring
to the cothurnus of the tragic actor or even the soccus of
the comedian. Dealing with the mimus of literature Teuffel
says ‘At the same time' (at the end of the Republic) ‘the
number of its subjects was enlarged, and its form was

Emperors, when the Mimus prevailed in company with the
silent pantomimus books were written by Philistion, Catullus
and LentuluS, besides whom we hear also of Hostilius,
Marullus, Atticus, Vergilius Romanus, Aemilius Severianus
and Aesopus. Our information about the character of the
mimi of this period enables us to draw conclusions as to the
original character of the whole specieS‚ making allowance
for the over-refined character of a later time, and keeping in
mind that after the absorption of all other kinds of drama in
the mimus, a more varied action was developed in it and it
arrived at greater independence.'

As a good laugh was the chief aim of the mime all through
its career, the actors (there were several in the middle period
and many in later times) wore harlequin's jackets, indulged in
comic gesticulation, made faces, imitated the sounds of birds
and beasts and played the fool generally. The actresses‚

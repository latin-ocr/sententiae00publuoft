xx INTRODUCTION.

V. SENTENCES.

Quintilian devotes a chapter (8, 5) to the kinds of
Sentences. ‘Antiquissimae sunt‚' he says, ‘ quae proprie
quamvis omnibus idem sit nomen, sententiae vocantur, quas
Graeci γνώμας appellant: utrumque autem nomen ex eo
acceperunt, quod similes sunt consiliis, aut decretis.’ Just as
in the middle ages Florilegia were, and in our own days
‘Familiar quotations’ are, in vogue, so was there probably a
similar tendency in classic times. In the case of mimes,
which were often themselves of an ephemeral nature, this was
even a necessity. Accordingly we find that not many decades
after the death of Publilius, a collection of Publilian sentences
was made. What the collector's object was we do not know,
but we gather from what Seneca says (Epistol. 3 3, 7), ‘pueris
sententias ediscendas damus,' that the collection was used in
schools. This is confirmed by the words of Jerome quoted
above (p. xvi), “Legi quondam in scholis puer ‘Aegre reprendas'
etc.'' We have no means of deciding whether the original
arrangement was or was not alphabetical, but it seems likely
enough to have been so. The present alphabetical arrange-
ment, in which no attention is paid to the second letter of the
word which begins the sentence, is at least medieval.

The chief difficulties which have arisen in the attempts to
establish the text of Publilius are due to the alterations of
Christian copyists and the duplication of sentences by school-
masters or scholars. Of the former fact there can be no
doubt, as a collator of the various texts frequently catches the
anti-pagan emendator in the act. Of the latter we cannot be
absolutely certain, but any one who reads the sentences,
especially in such an edition as Bothe's‚ will notice that there
seem to be small groups of sentences built on certain models,

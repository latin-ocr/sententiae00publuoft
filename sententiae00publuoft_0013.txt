INTRODUCTION.

1. THE AUTHOR'S NAME.

UNTu. the beginning of the sixteenth centugy the EQAESQQJ.

EmS—-It waS‚ moreover‚ only quite recently at the hands
of Sillig the 'editor of Pliny, that the name of Publilius
was substituted for the monstrosum nomen (so E. Woelfflin calls
it) of Publius, although the latter form was preserved in manu-
scripts of Cicero, the Senecas, Gellius, Macrobius and Jerome.
Woelfflin, supported by Ritschl, definitely established the
name Publilius, which has been accepted by such authorities
as Baehr and Teuffel.

Pliny in his Natural History (35, 5199) says: ‘Publilium
Lochium mimicae scaenae conditorem et astrologiae conso-
brinum eius Manilium Antiochum, item grammaticae Staberium
Erotem eadem nave advectos videre proavi,' which appears to
give Publilius the second name of Lochius‚ and both Ο. Jahn
and Woelfflin have conjectured that the name should be
Antiochium, which seems not unlikely, as we find his cousin
called Antiochus. Woelfflin points out a similar error in the
Medicean MS. of Tacitus (13. 7) where t‘oclzum is found for
Antiochum. This of course agrees very well with the cog-

 

' nomen of Syrus, which is usually given him, probably out of
- Macrobius.

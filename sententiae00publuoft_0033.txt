Fol. [Mathias Moravus.] Neap. 1475. In the editio princeps
of Seneca. Quaritch‚ who has offered it at 5563, ³520,
,ξ 18 and A 15, says ‘This very rare volume is the most
important production of the early press at N aples (except
only the Horace of 1474 of which but one copy is known).'

Fol. [Bernardus de Colonia] Tarv. 1478. Reprinted from
the preceding 3 Gothic letter, priced by Quaritch at A 5 »
and A 5. 55. Hain mentions seventeen of these partial
editions besides three Spanish versions.

Erasmus. 4⁰. Basil. 1502. ‘Prouerbia Senecae secundum
ordinem alphabeti' 3 after a Cambridge Manuscript with
the editor's scholia, according to Fabricius, but not
mentioned by Panzer, and quite legendary.

1. Erasmus, 4⁰. [Peter Treveris] Sodov. 1514. Proved
by Fr. Latendorf in 1868 (according to Woelfflin) to be
the real editio princeps of Publilius, but still in dispute.
There is no evidence of any other book having been
printed at Southwark as early as this. The full title of the
book is said to be ‘ Disticha moralia, titulo Catonis, cum
scholiis auctis Erasmi Roterodami. Apophthegmata
Graeciae Sapientum‚ interprete Erasmo. Eadem, per
Ausonium cum schol. Erasmi. Mimi Publiani, cum eiusd.
schol. auctis recogniti. J. Coleti institutum hominis

Christiani, carmine per eundem Erasmum Roterod.'
Erasmus took the name of Publius Syrus and a few verses

from Gellius and got rid of the name of Seneca and the
prose sentences

2. 4⁰. [Martinus werdensis] Colon. 1514. With Cat0.

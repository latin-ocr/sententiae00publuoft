PREFACE.

HE last English edition of Publilius, unless the
joint-publication at London and Tiibingen of

Tafel's very partial edition of 1841 should be so counted, .

was the little Eton volume of 1824—and this in spite of
the fact that the editio princeps of Publilius is supposed to
have been printed at Southwark. But the shortcomings
of our country are not even here shown at their worst‚
for, whereas since the beginning of the seventeenth
century continental editions have shared in the riches of
Martin Welser's discovery of the Frisingen manuscript,
no English edition, owing possibly to the authoritative
example of Bentley, has ever yet contained 4oo lines,
This is indeed so extraordinary that I hope it will
justify the attempt of an amateur to supply the
deficiency.

With regard to my general plan—I must confess to
having made no pilgrimages after leading or novel
codices, In the first place the work of many very
learned men in Germany and of some in France has
rendered this unnecessary, as an approximately perfect
collation of all the various MSS. has already been made,
and in the second 1 should not presume to think myself
competent to do such very delicate experience-requiring

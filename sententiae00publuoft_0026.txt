XXii INTRODUCTION.

2. Pb. Parisinus, latinus 7641. Xth cent. INCIPIUNT
SENTENTIAE SENECE XLVI. Very similar to Pa,
being either a copy of it, or from a common

source, sharing with it several very obvious
blunderS. Collated by W.' Meyer.

3. R. Rheinaugiensis 95 Turici. Xth cent. ANNEI SE-
NECAE PROVERmA. ‘Parisinis proximus est et
aetate et bonitate' Woelfflin. Collated by W. ’
Meyer.

4. B. Basiliensis A, N. 1v. 11, formerly K. 111. 34.
Xth cent. Without inscription. It breaks off
at v. 296, but as this is the end of a folio one
cannot say how many more verses there may
have been. It was published by Jo. Casp. Orelli
(at the heel of his Phaedrus) at Turin in 1832,
wh0‚ according to Woelfflin, ‘non satis distinxit
quae manu secunda addita aut correcta sunt.'
A. Spengel accuses Woelfflin of esteeming this

MS. too highly, and himself places it after Pa,
Pb and R.

ut deterioribus libris sit adnumerandus,’ Woelfflin.
Collated by W. Meyer.

lilian and other sentences. Of some slight
value3 collated by W. Meyer, v. his ‘Samm-
lungen' pp· 9, 55-57·

8. Vat. Vaticanus, latinus 1783. XIth cent. ANN11

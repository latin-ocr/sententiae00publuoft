pages (4 of testimonia, 9 de collectionibuS‚ 2 de edition·
ibus) ; there are 723 sentenceS‚ of which 84 are not
accepted by Woelfflin, and a good index (verborum).
The probable history of the collections is very clearly
given, and in the text the sentences which are in
collection Σ come firs't, then those in Π (but not in Σ),
then those in Z, then those in O, and lastly those in Φ
labelled ‘Publilii esse videntur' 3 the letter indicating
the collection is placed before the first line of each set
of sentenceS, the arrangement being of course alpha-
betical as usual. At the beginning of the critical notes
for each letter of the alphabet a list is given of the MSS.
in which each sentence occurs. I consider Meyer’s text
the most accurate yet published.*

275. Otto Friedrich. 8⁰. Berol. 1880. ‘Publilii Syri Mimi
Sententiae‚' a book of 314 pageS. The preface (of 22

(with critical foot-notes), followed by a business-like con-

codex. Then come 198 sentences of Caecilius Balbus,
145 from Pseudo-seneca de moribuS, 126 Proverbia‚ and
390 sententiae ‘ falso inter Publilianas receptae! There
are 136 pages of clear-sighted exegetical notes to
Publilius, rather erring in the direction of superfluity, 57
pages of notes to the extra sentences and a fair index
verborum. The verses received by Bentley are marked
with an asterisk, and the scanning is shown throughout.
C. Hartung (Philol. Runds. Feb. 26. 1881) says “Alle
